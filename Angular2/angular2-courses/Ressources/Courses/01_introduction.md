## What, How, Where, Why, When & Who

We'll discover all the Angular 2 concepts and answer to all this kind of questions:
- What is a component?
- How do we set-up a two-way binding?
- Where do we put business logic?
- Why do we have to use `@ngModule`?
- Who is interested into Angular 2 application?
- etc.

## Angular is ...

- a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications,
- for client-side application,
- about developing across all platforms,
- about speed and performance,
- a large and extremely active community,
- a solid tooling ecosystem.

### Why Angular?

- Powerful data binding
    - Interpolation
    - Property binding
    - Event binding
    - Two-way binding
    - Fine-tuned configuration
- Enhance HTML
    - Add custom behavior to HTML
    - Powerup HTML
- Modular by design
    - Think as little box enhance maintenability
    - Enhance reuse of block
- Opiniated architecture
    - /!\ Can be a bad point for some person
    - All inclusive: DI, Routing, etc.

### Why Angular 2?

- Innovation
    - Work on upcoming standards
    - Large community = proactivity
    - Web Workers, Server-Side rendering, Tests & tooling, etc.
- Speed and Performances
    - Designed on AngularJS experiences
    - Mobile focus
    - Multi-thread with web Workers
- Learning curve
    - Easy to learn: everything is a Class with Decorators
    - Angular App = Module + Component + Service
    - Component = Template + Class
    - Service = Class
    - Module = Bunch of Component + Service
- Tooling
    - Large community
    - Mobile tooling (Angular Universal)
    - Debugging (Angular Augury, Angular BatScanner)
    - Testing (Karma, Protractor)
    - NodeJS Renderer (Server-Side Rendering)

### Community is beautiful

- AngularJS: Octobre 2015 => 1.1M
- AngularJS: Octobre 2016 => 1.2M
- Angular: Octobre 2016 => 700k+
